# Line Graphs

Line graphs are typically used for visualizing how one continuous variable, on the y-axis, changes in relation to another continuous variable, on the x-axis. Often the *x* variable represents time, but it may also represent some other continuous quantity, for example, the amount of a drug administered to experimental subjects.

As with bar graphs, there are exceptions. Line graphs can also be used with a discrete variable on the x-axis. This is appropriate when the variable is ordered (e.g., "small", "medium", "large"), but not when the variable is unordered (e.g., "cow", "goose", "pig"). Most of the examples in this chapter use a continuous *x* variable, but we'll see one example where the variable is converted to a factor and thus treated as a discrete variable.

Let us prepare for this chapter by first importing a Vo2 treadmill test data that we have cleaned, and placed in the data folder. See Recipe \@ref(WRANGLE-SUMMARIZE-GROUPBY). The Excel sheet is called `"treadmill_pt4_clean.xlsx"`. 

```{r}
dat <-  read.xlsx (xlsxFile = "data/treadmill_pt4_clean.xlsx",
                   sheet = "Sheet1")

dat <- dat %>%
  mutate (stage = cut_interval(time, length = 210, labels = FALSE)) %>%
  group_by(stage) %>%
  mutate (row_id = row_number()) %>%
  filter (row_id < 37) %>%
  slice_tail (n = 6)%>%
  summarise_at (vars(bf:hr), mean)

```


## Making a Basic Line Graph {#LINE-GRAPH-BASIC-LINE}

```{r, echo = FALSE}
vembedr::embed_url("https://youtu.be/m0rdWRnWgc8")
```

### Problem

You want to make a basic line graph.

### Solution

Use `ggplot()` with `geom_line()`, and specify which variables you mapped to x and y (Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-BASIC-LINE)):

```{r FIG-LINE-GRAPH-BASIC-LINE, fig.cap="Basic line graph"}

ggplot(dat) +
  geom_line(aes(x = stage, y = vo2))  

```

### Discussion

In this sample data set, the *x* variable, `time`, is in one column and the *y* variable, `vo2`, is in another:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
dat %>%
  knitr::kable (digits = 2)
```


With ggplot2, the default *y* range of a line graph is just enough to include the *y* values in the data. For some kinds of data, it's better to have the *y* range start from zero. You can use `ylim()` to set the range, or you can use `expand_limits()` to expand the range to include a value. This will set the range from zero to the maximum value of the demand column in `BOD` (Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-BASIC-LINE-YLIM)):

```{r eval=F}
# These have the same result
ggplot(dat) +
  geom_line(aes(x = stage, y = vo2))  +
  ylim(0, max(dat$vo2))

ggplot(dat) +
  geom_line(aes(x = stage, y = vo2)) +
  expand_limits(y = 0)
```

```{r FIG-LINE-GRAPH-BASIC-LINE-YLIM, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Line graph with manually set y range"}
# This code block is so that it generates just one of the plots from above
ggplot(dat) +
  geom_line(aes(x = stage, y = vo2)) +
  expand_limits(y = 0)
```


## Making a Line Graph with Multiple Lines {#LINE-GRAPH-MULTIPLE-LINE}

```{r, echo = FALSE}
vembedr::embed_url("https://youtu.be/VlyE4ZB0RPM")
```


### Problem

You want to make a line graph with more than one line.

### Solution

In addition to the variables mapped to the x- and y-axes, map another (discrete) variable to colour or linetype, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-MULTI-LINE-COLOR-TYPE):

```{r FIG-LINE-GRAPH-MULTI-LINE-COLOR-TYPE, fig.show="hold", fig.cap="A variable mapped to colour (left); A variable mapped to linetype (right)"}

# Bring all variables into one column

dat_long <- dat %>%
  dplyr::select (stage, vo2, vco2) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(vo2:vco2),
               names_to = "var",
               values_to = "val") %>%
  mutate (var = factor (var))

# Map supp to colour
ggplot(dat_long) +
  geom_line(aes(x = stage, y = val, colour = var))

# Map supp to linetype
ggplot(dat_long) +
  geom_line(aes(x = stage, y = val, linetype = var))
```

### Discussion

The `dat_long` data has three columns, including the factor `var`, which we mapped to `colour` and `linetype`:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
dat_long %>%
  knitr::kable (digits = 2)
```

> **Note**
>
> If the *x* variable is a factor, you must also tell ggplot to group by that same variable, as described below.

Line graphs can be used with a continuous or categorical variable on the x-axis. Sometimes the variable mapped to the x-axis is *conceived* of as being categorical, even when it's stored as a number. In the example here, there are eight values of stage: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. You may want to treat these as categories rather than values on a continuous scale. To do this, convert `stage` to a factor (Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-MULTI-LINE-FACTOR)):

```{r FIG-LINE-GRAPH-MULTI-LINE-FACTOR, fig.cap="Line graph with continuous x variable converted to a factor"}

ggplot(dat_long) +
  geom_line(aes(x = factor (stage), y = val, colour = var, group = var))

```

To convert a variable to a factor , see also Recipe \@ref(WRANGLE-CHARACTERS-2-FACTORS).

Notice the use of `group = var`. Without this statement, ggplot won't know how to group the data together to draw the lines, and it will not plot anything:

```{r}

ggplot(dat_long) +
  geom_line(aes(x = factor (stage), y = val, colour = var))

```

## Changing the Appearance of Lines {#LINE-GRAPH-LINE-APPEARANCE}

```{r, echo = FALSE}
vembedr::embed_url("https://youtu.be/xOWAMHWUxC4")
```

### Problem

You want to change the appearance of the lines in a line graph.

### Solution

The type of line (solid, dashed, dotted, etc.) is set with `linetype`, the thickness (in mm) with `size`, and the color of the line with `colour` (or `color`).

These properties can be set (as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-GRAPH-BASIC-LINE-CUSTOMIZED)) by passing them values in the call to `geom_line()`:

```{r FIG-BAR-GRAPH-BASIC-LINE-CUSTOMIZED, fig.cap="Line graph with custom linetype, size, and colour"}
ggplot(dat) +
  geom_line(aes(x = stage, y = vo2), 
            linetype = "dashed", size = 1, colour = "blue")
```

If there is more than one line, setting the aesthetic properties will affect all of the lines. On the other hand, *mapping* variables to the properties, as we saw in Recipe \@ref(LINE-GRAPH-MULTIPLE-LINE), will result in each line looking different. The default colors aren't the most appealing, so you may want to use a different palette, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-MULTI-LINE-PALETTE), by using `scale_colour_brewer()` or `scale_colour_manual()`:

```{r FIG-LINE-GRAPH-MULTI-LINE-PALETTE, fig.cap="Using a palette from RColorBrewer"}

ggplot(dat_long) +
  geom_line(aes(x = stage, y = val, colour = var)) +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1")


```

### Discussion

To set a single constant color for all the lines, specify colour outside of `aes()`. The same works for size, linetype, and point shape (Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-MULTI-LINE-CONSTANT-AES)). You may also have to specify the grouping variable:


(ref:cap-FIG-LINE-GRAPH-MULTI-LINE-CONSTANT-AES) Line graph with constant size and color (left); With `supp` mapped to `colour`, and with points added (right)

```{r FIG-LINE-GRAPH-MULTI-LINE-CONSTANT-AES, fig.show="hold", fig.cap="(ref:cap-FIG-LINE-GRAPH-MULTI-LINE-CONSTANT-AES)"}
# If both lines have the same properties, you need to specify a variable to
# use for grouping

ggplot(dat_long) +
  geom_line(aes(x = stage, y = val, group = var),
            colour = "darkgreen", size = 1.5) 

# Since supp is mapped to colour, it will automatically be used for grouping
ggplot(dat_long) +
  geom_line(aes(x = stage, y = val, colour = var), linetype = "dashed") +  
  geom_point(aes(x = stage, y = val, colour = var),shape = 22, size = 3, fill = "white")

```

The range of different linetypes that is available can be seen in (Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINETYPE-AES))

```{r FIG-LINETYPE-AES, fig.cap= "The different types of linetype you can use.", fig.show="hold",  echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(c("images/chapter-7/linetype.png"))


```


## Using Themes to Change Overall Appearance of Plot {#LINE-GRAPH-APPEARANCE-THEME}

```{r, echo = FALSE}
vembedr::embed_url("https://youtu.be/IpmG8N8u6lw")
```

### Problem

You want to use premade themes to control the overall plot appearance.

### Solution

There are many premade themes that are already included in ggplot2. The default ggplot2 theme is `theme_grey()`, but the examples below also showcase `theme_bw()`, `theme_minimal()`, and `theme_classic()`.

To use a premade theme, add `theme_bw()` or another theme to your plot (Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-APPEARANCE-THEME)):


(ref:cap-FIG-APPEARANCE-THEME) Scatter plot with `theme_grey()` (the default, top left); with `theme_bw()` (top right); with `theme_minimal()` (bottom left); with `theme_classic()` (bottom right)

```{r FIG-APPEARANCE-THEME, fig.show="hold", fig.cap="(ref:cap-FIG-APPEARANCE-THEME)"}
# Create the base plot

hw_plot <- ggplot(dat) +
  geom_line(aes(x = stage, y = vo2)) 

# Grey theme (the default)

hw_plot +
  theme_grey()

# Black-and-white theme

hw_plot +
  theme_bw()

# Minimal theme without background annotations

hw_plot +
  theme_minimal()

# Classic theme, with axis lines but no gridlines

hw_plot +
  theme_classic()
```


## Learning check {#LINE-GRAPH-LEARNING-CHECK}

```{r, echo = FALSE}
vembedr::embed_url("https://youtu.be/7M5_GRm6bYM")
```

1. From your learning check in \@ref(BAR-LEARNING-CHECK), open up your `practice_script.R`. 

2. Import the Excel file `data/Athlete_1_treadmill.xlsx`, and the sheet `raw`, and assign it to an object `dat`. See  Recipe \@ref(INPUT-IMPORT). Also import the the sheet `stage` from the same file, and assign it to an object `dat_stage`.

2. Rename the columns of `dat` to be `("time", "bf", "vo2_norm", "rer", "vo2", "vco2", "ve", "hr")`, respectively. See Recipe \@ref(WRANGLE-RENAME-VARIABLES).

3. Remove the first row of the `dat` data, as it is useless. See Recipe \@ref(WRANGLE-SLICE).

4. Convert the variable `time` of `dat` into numeric seconds, and all other variables to numeric. See Recipe \@ref(WRANGLE-CHARACTER-2-TIME) and \@ref(WRANGLE-CHARACTER-2-NUMERIC), respectively.

5. Create a variable called `stage`, where each stage represents 3:30 min worth of VO2 data. See Recipe \@ref(WRANGLE-NUMERIC-CATEGORY).

6. For each stage, create a variable called `row_id`, which essentially represents the number of 5 sec windows in each stage. See Recipe \@ref(WRANGLE-NEW-VARIABLES) and \@ref(WRANGLE-SUMMARIZE-GROUPBY).

7. For each stage, remove the data between 3 to 3:30min. See Recipe \@ref(WRANGLE-SUMMARIZE-GROUPBY) and \@ref(WRANGLE-FILTER-KEEP-NUMERIC).

8. For each stage, keep the last six rows of data. See Recipe \@ref(WRANGLE-SUMMARIZE-GROUPBY) and \@ref(WRANGLE-SLICE).

9. For each stage, calculate for all variables for the mean of the last six rows of data. See Recipe \@ref(WRANGLE-SUMMARIZE-GROUPBY) and \@ref(WRANGLE-SUMMARIZE-GLOBAL). Assign this table to an object called `dat_summ`.

10. Merge the two tables `dat_summ` and `dat_stage`, by the common variable called `stage`. See Recipe \@ref(WRANGLE-INNER-JOIN). Assign this table to an object called `df_plot`.

11. Using `df_plot`, make a line plot with with `speed` as the *x* axis, and `vo2` as the *y* axis, and assign it to an object called `f`. See Recipe \@ref(LINE-GRAPH-BASIC-LINE).

12. Save image `f` to a file called `myfig.png`. See Recipe \@ref(BAR-OUTPUT-BITMAP).

13. You must be wondering, why can't I see the figure. What must you do to print the picture? See Recipe \@ref(INSTALL-READ-WRITE-CODE).
